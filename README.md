## Programming Notes

30,000+ lines of C code in this repo produce the HTML reports and data for the
in-app screen reports.  To bring the reports to Android / web / PC / Mac  etc,
this C code is re-usable but, obviously, the user interface must be redone.

The repo contains fully functional commented out code which supported
a Share button for Groups of people.  You could export > email > import
any group.  Privacy concerns.

The repo contains fully functional commented out code which produced
a Calendar year report showing one graph of stress levels across a full year
from jan - dec instead of 2 graphs jan - jun and jul - dec.  Too wide.

## Debug Logging Maintenance
######  TURNING OFF and ON logging output for NSLog logging 
    > in github folder "meandmyBFFs/Me and My BFFs/"
    > in file "Me and My BFFs-Prefix.pch" 
    > at the end of the file, there is this:

      // UNCOMMENTING  the line below ( #define NSLog(...) )   TURNS OFF LOGGING  throughout the App
      // #define NSLog(...)
      // leaving the line above commented out   TURNS ON LOGGING  throughout the App


######  TURNING OFF and ON logging output for rkdebug C logging functions
    > in github folder "meandmyBFFs/Me and My BFFs/"
    > in file "rkdebug.c"
    > around line 133,  there is this:
      // int RKDEBUG=1;  /* set to 1 to turn off output in all these log functions */
      int RKDEBUG=0;     /* set to 0 to turn on  output in all these log functions */
